Firstly, let's explain what the credit market it. In essence, the credit market is where people and companies borrow money.It includes things like bank loans, bonds, and private lending. Lenders give money now and expect repayment with interest later. This article says credit markets are becoming riskier, especially in private credit, which has grown quickly but is hard to see into. Private credit means loans made outside banks, and while it has helped fill gaps since 2008, it comes with hidden dangers like complex structures and loans that are hard to sell in a crisis. Recent company failures show borrowers may be weaker than they look. If stress builds, problems in private credit could spread to banks, bonds, and investors, making the whole financial system unstable. As more rules and openness are needed,  stricter lending could also make borrowing harder and more costly for smaller or riskier firms, slowing growth.
