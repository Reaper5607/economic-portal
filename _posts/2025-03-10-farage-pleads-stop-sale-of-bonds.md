Firstly, to understand this post, we must understand what quantitative tightening is. Quantitative tightening occurs when the Bank of England sells government bonds with the intention of not replacing them. During quantitative tightening, the Bank of England sells those bonds back from during creating new ones during quantitative easing, and as a result pushes borrowing costs up. For the UK economy, QT makes government borrowing more expensive and can slow growth, but it also helps bring down inflation. So in the topic of this article, Nigel Farage (UK Reform leader), asked the governer of the Bank of England to ask to end the process of quantitative tightening, as selling government bonds is worsening taxpayers and pushing up UK debt costs. The article also mentions Nigel Farage's cryptocurrency concerns, begging for looser regulations.
