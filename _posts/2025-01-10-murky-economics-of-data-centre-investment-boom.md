This article presents the fact that there has been a huge surge in investment into data-centres mostly due to the rise of artificial intelligence taking over many sectors. They facilities host computing hardware and servers. However, there is an ethical argument taking place referring to the "murkiness" of how much profit these projects will generate and how sustainable they are. In essence, billions of pounds are being poured into data centres to fuel the AI boom, but with high costs and power limits, economies may be at risk.
